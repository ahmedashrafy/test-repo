feat: Implement navigation structure A/B test

Implement A/B test comparing flat vs. nested expandable navigation to improve
user engagement and time-on-page metrics for documentation site.

Changes:
- Add navigation structure variants (flat control vs. nested expandable)
- Implement CSS styling with smooth expand/collapse animations
- Add comprehensive JavaScript for A/B test logic and metrics tracking
- Include feature flags for testing and debugging
- Add analytics integration with multiple provider support

Features:
- Automatic 50/50 variant assignment with localStorage persistence
- URL parameter override (?nav_variant=flat|nested) for testing
- Comprehensive metrics tracking:
  * Average time on page
  * Number of sections explored
  * Scroll depth (0-100%)
  * Navigation clicks
  * Section toggle events
  * Scroll depth milestones
- Google Analytics integration (auto-detected)
- Custom analytics endpoint support
- Beacon API for reliable final metrics transmission
- Browser console debugging tools

Technical Details:
- Self-contained IIFE to avoid namespace pollution

- Metrics tracking verified in console
- CSS transitions smooth and performant
- Feature flags working correctly
- localStorage persistence confirmed
